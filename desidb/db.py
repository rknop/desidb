            DBCon to that function, and then in that function have it
            pass the DBCon to its DBCon constructor.

            be rolled back and closed when the context exits if you
            passed a non-None con.  The assumption is that there was an

            (the rows) and a list of strings (the column names).

            cached in the class, so the connection will only happen the
            first time you make an object of each subclass.)

          cols : list of str
            Column names.  Properties of self with these names will be created.

          vals : list
            Value that go with cols.

          **kwargs : additional arguments
            Instead of passing cols and vals, you can pass the
            properties to be set in the object as named parameters to
            __init__.

          _noinit : bool
            Don't actually initialize the object.  Use this if you just
            need an object and don't have any cols or vals to pass right
            now.  This is probably hardly ever useful, but there are all
            kinds of python games you might play.

          noconvert : bool, default True
            If True, assign the values in vals directly to the
            properties of self whose names are in cols.  If False,
            then vals will be run through the type converters for the
            columns, if any, to convert postgres types to python types.
